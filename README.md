# Telecom-Customer-Churn

üìû Project Overview:
Objective: Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, enabling targeted retention efforts.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and transformed the telecom dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
Applied feature encoding to convert categorical variables (e.g., customer contract types, payment methods) into a format suitable for machine learning.

Feature Engineering:
Analyzed feature importance and correlations to identify key drivers of churn.
Created additional features based on customer interaction, such as tenure and service usage patterns.

Modeling:
Tried multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Fine-tuned models using cross-validation and grid search to improve performance.

Model Evaluation:
Assessed model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.
The XGBoost model performed best, offering the highest accuracy and F1 score in predicting churn.

Insights & Recommendations:
Key Drivers of Churn: High churn rates were observed among customers with short tenure and those using month-to-month contracts.
Actionable Insights: Suggested implementing loyalty programs and offering discounts for long-term contracts to reduce churn rates.

üí° Skills Gained:
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Developed strong skills in preparing real-world telecom data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Gained insights into creating relevant features to enhance model performance.
Machine Learning: Hands-on experience with classification algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
Churn Prediction: Learned the business significance of churn prediction and how data-driven insights can inform strategic decisions.
Python Libraries: Utilized Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and model development.
